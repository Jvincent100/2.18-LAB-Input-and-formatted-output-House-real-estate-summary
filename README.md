<h1>2.18 LAB: Input and formatted output: House real estate summary</h1>
<p></p>Sites like Zillow get input about house prices from a database and provide nice summaries for readers. Write a program with two inputs, current price and last month's price (both integers). Then, output a summary listing the price, the change since last month, and the estimated monthly mortgage computed as (currentPrice * 0.051) / 12 (Note: Output directly, do not store in a variable, and end with a newline).</p>

Note: Getting the precise spacing, punctuation, and newlines exactly right is a key point of this assignment. Such precision is an important part of programming.
